                    Respected Ma’am,
                    
                    This is to inform you that my mother is seriously ill and I am required to stay with her as there is no one else to take care of her. 
                    She is required to be taken to the hospital every now and then and needs constant support as doctors have advised complete bed rest. 
                    So, I request you to kindly allow me a week’s leave, starting today, 16/09/2021 to 23/09/2021.
                    
                    My friends have assured me to bring every day’s notes, and I will submit all my work through them. My Class Teacher is also very supportive. 
                    She has promised to send me audio recordings of classes so that I would not miss out on anything during this period. 
                    With everyone’s support, I am sure I can get through this difficult phase.
                    
                    Thank you in advance for your kind understanding.
                    
                    Yours faithfully,
